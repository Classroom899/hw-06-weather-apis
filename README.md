# hw-06-weather-apis

For this weather app utilizing the OpenWeather API, current temperature will be displayed based upon what city the user inputs. Wind, current temperature in fahrenheit will show, along with the current humidity for that searched city. The city is also going to be saved at the top of the page.

UV Index and five day forecast require two separate APIs. These APIs are not finished yet on this project.
